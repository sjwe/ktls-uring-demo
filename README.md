# ktls-uring-demo

A demo HTTPS client exploring the integration boundaries between
io_uring-based networking (via tokio-uring) and userspace TLS (rustls) in rust

The project uses io_uring for asynchronous TCP connection setup and rustls
for portable TLS encryption. HTTP methods supported include GET, POST, PUT,
PATCH, and DELETE

## Architecture Notes

- TLS is handled in userspace thru rustls for portability
- Because rustls operates on blocking Read/Write streams, encrypted I/O
  does not fully leverage io_uring
- File descriptor duplication (via `libc::dup()`) bridges tokio-uring's
  ownership model with rustls's synchronous I/O requirement

## Known Behaviors

The client gracefully handles servers that close connections without sending
TLS `close_notify` alerts (commonly observed with `Connection: close`)
This behavior is technically a protocol violation under TLS 1.2, but is
widespread in real-world deployments and intentionally tolerated by most
TLS implementations

## Usage

```bash
cargo run
```
